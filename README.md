# Pygaplat2

This is my second framework for platformers. My first one was a learning
experience and I made one game with it. Pretty fun overall, but and it 
gave me ideas that I'd like to recreate from scratch.

## New Planned Features
- New HUD :D
- HP
- Dictionary for level design.
- Dictionary for global game state.
- Different collision system (masks?)
- Richer features with level editor:
    - Place player
    - Assign entity behavior
    - Assign message
    - Assign level to doors
    - Message editor
    - Behavior editor
- ...music & sound effects
- Boss fights

## Philosophy
Pygaplat2 should make creating simple metroidvanias possible. I'm going 
to recreate all the features I wrote in Pygapla1 from scratch for the
sake of learning.
